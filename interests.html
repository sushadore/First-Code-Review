            <h4>My favorite thing</h4>
            <p>...is being with the people I love. Could be friends, could be my extensive family. Generally this involves any combination of outside, laughing, moving, costumes, hugs, food, games, and travel. It does not involve lots of money, pretention or sitting unless it's time for stories, cards or crying on shoulders.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Skiing</strong> ~ In case my homepage didn't give it away, I spend most of my winter free time skiing and have a pass to <a href="https:www.skihood.com/">Mt. Hood Meadows</a> every season. I've been skiing there off and on for 26 years!</li>
              <li><strong>Dancing</strong> ~ Partner dancing is something I enjoy so much that I often travel to Texas or Louisiana to find good dancers and sometimes I even teach Texas two-step and waltz!</li>
              <li><strong>Cooking</strong> ~ Though it is easy to ge sucked in to the dining out vortex in Portland I also like to cook, experimenting with flavors and ingredients. Pro: saves money, con: dishes</li>
            </li><strong>Motorcyle Riding</strong> ~ Solo or with friends, I absolutely love riding! It's like flying. I discovered motorcycle camping and look forward to a cross country trip in the future, after school really.</li>
